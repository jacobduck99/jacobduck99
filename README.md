### ⚠️ Learning software like the world’s ending — because it might be.
(Hopefully not — I always use my manners with AI.) 

## 🧠 About Me

I’m in a race to learn software before either WW3 happens or AI takes over.

I enjoy tackling problems and turning them into bite-sized puzzles that cause me a lot of pain — but give me the most dopamine.

I guess you could call me a code junkie.

I’ve always been into LEGO — breaking things apart, figuring out how they fit, and building something cooler.

So when I picked up backend programming, I fell in love instantly. To me, it’s just adult LEGO: writing code, one bug... I mean one block at a time.

My end goal is to become a full-stack developer who can solve problems fast and build technology that actually impacts users. That’s why I’ve recently picked up Neovim — because I want speed, control, and zero distractions.

I kind of enjoy spending hours a day banging my head against a wall just to get 1% better.

As the Japanese say — _kaizen, baby!_

**P.S.**  
Your code is never going to be perfect. You’ll cringe every time you revisit it. So just write.  
That’s my motto, anyway.
