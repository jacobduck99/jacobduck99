### Learning software like the worldâ€™s ending â€” because it might be.
(Hopefully not â€” I always use my manners with AI.) 

## ðŸ§  About Me

Iâ€™m in a race to learn software before either WW3 happens or AI takes over.

I enjoy tackling problems and turning them into bite-sized puzzles that cause me a lot of pain â€” but give me the most dopamine.

I guess you could call me a code junkie.

Iâ€™ve always been into LEGO â€” breaking things apart, figuring out how they fit, and building something cooler.

So when I picked up backend programming, I fell in love instantly. To me, itâ€™s just adult LEGO: writing code, one bug... I mean one block at a time.

My end goal is to become a full-stack developer who can solve problems fast and build technology that actually impacts users. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™ve recently picked up Neovim â€” because I want speed, control, and zero distractions.

I kind of enjoy spending hours a day banging my head against a wall just to get 1% better.

As the Japanese say â€” _kaizen, baby!_

**P.S.**  
Your code is never going to be perfect. Youâ€™ll cringe every time you revisit it. So just write.  
Thatâ€™s my motto, anyway.
